# Ionic-App

A small expense managing app with Ionic.

## Used guide
[A simple todo app with Ionic](https://devdactic.com/ionic-4-firebase-angularfire)

**NB!** The topic of the app was changed to add additional content.

## Review of the guide

The guide was very informative about the features of Ionic. The tutorial used a simple
todo app as an example so that newcomers would be able to setup a Ionic app fast and easy.
The guide was not outdated as much as the react-native tutorial - the code used in the tutorial
did not need any updating.

Also this guide provided the opportunity to experiment with the second realtime database version Firebase - Firebase Cloudstore.

## Additional content (which was added to the app)
* Styling was changed and additional icons were used to indicate input values to the user.
* In addition to adding/removing/updating expenses, the user also sees the total amount on the home page of the app.
* The total amount is updated on addition/removal/changing of an expense.

## Used technologies
* [Ionic-Cli](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli) (v 4.12.0)
* [Node Package Manager - NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v 6.4.1)
* [Firebase Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)
